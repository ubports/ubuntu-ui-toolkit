    \brief Picker is a slot-machine style value selection component.

    The Picker lists the elements specified by the \l model using the \l delegate
    vertically using a slot-machine tumbler-like list. The selected item is
    always the one in the center of the component, and it is represented by the
    \l selectedIndex property.

    The elements can be either in a circular list or in a normal list.

    Delegates must be composed using PickerDelegate.

    Example:
    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import Ubuntu.Components 0.1
    import Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 0.1

    Picker {
        model: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
        delegate: PickerDelegate {
            Label {
                text: modelData
            }
        }
        selectedIndex: 5
        onSelectedIndexChanged: {
            print("selected month: " + selectedIndex);
        }
    }
    \endqml

    \b Note: the \l selectedIndex must be set explicitly to the desired index if
    the model is set, filled or changed after the component is complete. In the
    following example the selected item must be set after the model is set.

    \qml
    Picker {
        selectedIndex: 5 // this will be set to 0 at the model completion
        delegate: PickerDelegate {
            Label {
                text: modelData
            }
        }
        Component.onCompleted: {
            var stack = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                stack.push("Line " + i);
            }
            model = stack;
            // selectedIndex must be set explicitly
            selectedIndex = 3;
        }
    }
    \endqml
