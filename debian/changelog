  [ Tim Peeters ]
  * Disable header animations to avoid bugs when popping a PageStack in a loop. 
    Fixes LP: #1461729
  * New header visuals, using the ActionBar and Sections components.  
  * Introduce the new Sections component.
  * Fix initialization for hidden and locked header.

  [ Benjamin Zeller ]

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Fix AlamrModel segfault when updating elements. Fixes LP: #1463430

  [ Vincent Ladeuil ]
  * In the initctl test fixture,add the option to unset an environment variable
  
  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * QQmlContextData.url is a method in 5.5.0. Fixes LP: #1461897.
  * OrientationHelper shouldn't move depending on availableHeight. The 
    parentChanged/availableHeight change in OrientationHelper is the bug fix 
    itself. The new property UbuntuApplication.inputMethod defaults to 
    Qt.inputMethod and the unit test overrides it to reproduce the bug (fix) 
    regardless of device and input method setup - the mock keyboard is NOT 
    expected to be fully functional, buttons are but a placeholder irrelevant 
    for the test case.
    I removed hideInputPanel() as it's not being used anywhere, not essential 
    to the bug, but mainly unconfusing anyone working with the code as to what 
    actually affects inputMethod visibility. 
    Fixes LP: #1428206, LP: #1455406, LP: #1466222.
  * Use a custom sort function for type names.
  * Popover sizing should depend on whether it has a target.
  * Replace Styles page with a header action.

  * Previous logic was based on screen orientation which is not in sync with 
    OrientationHelper.qml. Fixes LP: #1455567.
 
  [ Timo Jyrinki ] 
  * Change -html documentation runtime dependencies into Suggests only to limit
    ubuntu-sdk download size. We're switching to offering only .qch offline 
    documentation in SDK (inside of it), and they're being added to the seed.

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * Optimized Slider and ProgressBar components. Switched to the native 
    UbuntuShapeOverlay instead of PartialColorizeUbuntuShape to render 
    the progression in the Slider and ProgressBar components. The 
    rendering is now faster since it removes an FBO indirection and 
    enables batching by the QtQtuick renderer.

    rendering. Fixes LP: #1396170
  * Removed misleading statement from UbuntuShape documentation.
    Fixes LP: #1430198
  * Renamed the overlayGeometry property to overlayRect. The 
    overlayGeometry being of type QRect, using overlayRect instead 
    makes it more precise, less generic. Fixes LP: #1430278
  * Converted sourceOpacity from float to qreal. Respect the same

  * Second stage of simplification - divider group property is an item,
    simplifying the anchoring of the contentItem. PropertyChange does
    not backup the property binding, uses QQmlPropertyPrivate::write()
    with parameter to keep bindings. ListItemAnimator uses behavior to
    animate snapping. Styling got "styledItem" context property to obey
    general styling rules. clicked() and pressAndHold() emission fix
    when content is swiped.
  * Transferring the ListItem attached properties to ListItemStyle API.
    Most of the style API became redundant, and removed. Few API from
    ListItem were also removed as not needed. ListItemAnimator,
    UCListItemAttached and UCActionPanel classes removed.
    Panel swiping overshoot made elastic. Snapping animation transformed
    into SmoothedAnimation, uses velocity of 60GU/second. Turning

  * unitythemeiconprovider: manually load icons
    Previously, UnityThemeIconProvider used QIcon::fromTheme() to 
    lookup and load icons. That function uses fdo's default icon 
    lookup algorithm: it looks at the current theme and all parent
    themes for each icon in turn. We'd prefer a breadth-first search,
    where all icon names are looked up in the current theme before 
    falling back to the parent themes. This change implements fdo's 
    FindBestIcon() algorithm, which behaves like that.
    It also now properly support rectangular icons and always returns
    an icon with the requested size (adjusted for preserving the 
    aspect ratio).
    As a result, the Icon component is much simpler and only requires 
    height to be set for rectangular icons. Fixes LP: #1324184

    using fallback memory manager. Does not affect EDS backend 
    functionality. Prerequisite for further alarm changes.

  * Text input UX updates Changes:
    - text cursor carets (handlers) are shown only in touch 
      environment
    - long press handling
      - long tap selects the word under pressed area (if not 
        previously selected) and opens context menu - same as 
        right mouse click
      - long tap does not focus the non-focused component
      - long mouse press with left button does not do anything
    - tap and drag scrolls the content
    - left mouse button press and drag selects the text
    - text can be scrolled with mouse wheel and scrollbar only 
      beside the touchAndDrag
    NOTE: text caret tests are skipped when XVFB, as the 
          activeFocusItem is not set on that environment, which 
          causes text cursor not to be created.

    ValueSelector, Subtitled, Standard and Base list item components
  * Change parent of OptionSelectorDelegate from Standard to Empty,
    because it effectively disabled all the visuals of Standard.

  [ Andrew Hayzen ]
  * Currently there is no animation of the listItem when
    cancelItemRemoval() is called, which causes a 'jump' in the
    listItem, this allows for the animation to occur.

  * Deprecated the ubuntuuitoolkit.emulators namespace. Split the
    autopilot helpers in smaller files.

  * StateSaver does no longer save the component states upon
    destruction. State is saved when the application is deactivated
    (looses focus) and cleaned once the application gets re-activated

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * A qtdeclarative5-private-dev packaging change adding a dependency on
    libqt5v8-5-private-dev has been backported to all Ubuntu versions
    now, so this workaround can now be dropped - building both against
    Qt 5.2 and 5.0.2 works.
  * Add #include for QDebug to fix Qt 5.2 build.

  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * Split build and install steps in debian/rules.
  * Use integer Date constructor in date picker tests for Qt 5.2.
  * Run unit_x11 test cases via Xvfb and address failures. (LP:

    are restored. (LP: #1267039)
  * Removing obsolete functionality from QuickUtils. (LP: #1266707)
  * StateSaver failure with Repeater fixed. Indirectly fixes StateSaver
    with ListView and GridView. (LP: #1267900)
  * TabBar test case failure fix for Qt5.2. (LP: #1256930)
  * InverseMouseArea API test removed, being a duplicate of the other
    InverseMouseArea tests. Connecting to th eproper enabledChanged
    signal in InverseMouseArea resolves the warning in Qt5.2 stating
    enabledChanged was overwritten in QQuickMouseArea. (LP: #1266707)
  * Panel implementation for DatePicker. Presents the DatePicker either
    in a panel covering the OSK area or in a Popover, depending on the
    form factor and presence of input method provider.
  * Layout tests now wait for the currentLayout change completion. (LP:
    #1266707)
  * Extra QQmlEngine instance removed from plugin, which seemed to cause
    some race conditions with Qt5.2. As result UbuntuColors got
    transferred from context property into singleton object, Theme's
    palette creation delayed till its first access. (LP: #1266707)
  * DateUtils test failure fix. (LP: #1273893)

  [ Florian Boucault ]
  * Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery: reimplemented in a cleaner way the
    responsiveness of the UI. That will allow for working right-to-left
    support. (LP: #1172652, #1182599)
  * Added Right-to-Left languages support to most widgets and to the UI
    Toolkit Gallery. The following widgets now behave properly in RTL
    environments: - List Items - Popups - Slider - TextArea - TextField
    - Button - ProgressBar - Toolbar - Header - Switch Tabs still need
    to be reversed. Relayout issues had to be workarounded (QTBUG 35095)
    for Label and Row. . (LP: #1181740, #35095)

  [ Leo Arias ]
  * Added an autopilot emulator for list views, with tests.

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Layouting fails with Qt5.2 if the tests and components are not
    rendered upon testing. Layout unit tests have been transferred to
    X11 unit tests and tests on layout changes all wait till the layout
    change completes. Tested with Qt 5.0.2 and Qt 5.2 RC1. (LP:

  * Picker visuals facelift, prepared for Date- and TimePicker
    components.
  * Picker selectedIndex miss-behavior fix when model is
    cleared/cropped/reset.

  [ Florian Boucault ]
  * List item progression: use appropriate icon (same as Tabs' arrow)
    and fixes the issue of it being the wrong color in Dark and Gradient
    themes. (LP: #1236777)

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * tst_arguments: Do not use QTEST_MAIN QTEST_MAIN is 99.99% of the
    times what you want when running a Qt testcase but it creates a
    Q*Application and in this case that is not wanted since we are
    creating and destroying them as part of the test and Qt doesn't like
    when there's more than one Q*Application at the same time, so do
    without creating a Q*Application in main. This can of course have
    some implications but it seems that for this testcase all is fine.
    (LP: #1254747)
  * Make the model a var and not a ListModel ListModel is bound
    specifically to QQuickListModel By using a var we can use other
    QAbstractItemModel subclasses in the model.

  [ Nic ]
  * Removed stop animation on text every time an expansion/collapse is
    made. Fixes bug #1231939. (LP: #1231939)

    the selector's ListView height. Fixes bug #1256356. (LP: #1256356)

  * Reset hide timer when user interacts with toolbar or toolbar
    buttons. (LP: #1249031)
  * Improve detection of tab bar interaction. Now using the new
    TabBar.pressed property instead of TabBar.selectionMode property,
    because selectionMode may be changed without user interaction (for
    example, when resuming an app in a following MR), and then the
    toolbar should not automatically hide.
  * Open the toolbar and tabbar (without animating) when the app is
    resumed. (LP: #1246790)

    becomes less than flickable.height. - Update documentation for
    Page.flickable. (LP: #1156573, #1160175)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * Removed common.pri and coverage.pri files that were cluttering
    QtCreator making it harder to understand the real structure of the
    project. coverage.pri has been transformed into a feature file
    (coverage.prf) which works the same way as before.
  * Removed antiquated TextCustom class.
  * Removed unused old-style tabs delegate.
  * Removed UbuntuShape.qml and transferred code & documentation to
    shapeitem.cpp ShapeItem: renamed baseColor property into color.
  * UbuntuShape: simplified gradient implementation; gradientColor is
    now the same as color by default. .
  * Simplified theming infrastructure. There are no stylesheets anymore
    (.qmltheme file), only delegates remain. A theme is a QML module
    containing delegates whose names are standardized. The default theme
    is called 'Ambiance' and available from QML through 'import
    Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance 0.1'. The name of the current
    theme is set in ~/.config/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/theme.ini Writing a new
    theme is done by creating a QML module and adding it in the
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes folder. A theme inherits from another theme
    by containing a text file name 'parent_theme' whose first and only
    line is the name of the parent theme. * Moved themes/ directory to
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes so that themes are importable. * Simplified
    ThemeEngine and ThemeSettings class, removed the rest of the theming
    infrastructure (ItemStyle, Style, QmlThemeLoader, Selector,
    StyleCache). * Adapted all widgets to use the simplified theming
    technique: - new StyledItem class that has a 'style' Component
    property representing the delegate - all widgets that have delegates
    inherit from StyledItem - all widgets set the 'style' property to
    the corresponding delegate in the current theme by using
    Theme.createStyleComponent() - Ambiance's stylesheet property/values
    have been moved to where they are used (mostly to the delegates) -
    TextAreaDelegate: exposed background as Component property - Added a
    delegate specific to TextField: TextFieldDelegate - Renamed
    delegates so that they match their widget's name (e.g.
    EditorCursorDelegate.qml renamed to TextCursorDelegate.qml since
    it's the delegate of TextCursor.qml) * Renamed UITK_THEME_PATH into
    UBUNTU_UI_TOOLKIT_THEMES_PATH. (LP: #1152160, #1152161, #1152162,

    palette. (LP: #1098209)

    theme as for qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin so that the
    files end up in the same folder. (LP: #1197164)
  * Button: - implementation clean up - updated visual design - new
    'gradient' property.
  * When looking up the plugin's directory
    (UbuntuComponentsPlugin::baseUrl), a case was omitted: if another
    Ubuntu/Components directory exists and is present in the
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH then the lookup failed. This fix is temporary until
    Qt 5.1. (LP: #1197293)

ubuntu-ui-toolkit (0.1.46daily13.06.05.1-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Zoltán Balogh ]
  * update the example app for the latest UI Toolkit.
  * A simple app to check few locales.
  * Add qttools5-dev-tools to build dependencies to provide
    qhelpgenerator for creating QtC help files from documentation.
  * Build documentation and publish the qch file.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * [UbuntuShape] Correctly stored the current material. (LP: #1132771)
  * [UbuntuShape] Ensured the texture is available in updatePaintNode().
    (LP: #1171437)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * QML_IMPORT_PATH is deprecated for QtQuick 2.0. Switch to
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH.
  * Added syntax description for CHANGES file in CHANGES.syntax.
  * UCScalingImageProvider: respect 'requestedSize' parameter. That
    ensures that the 'sourceSize' property of Image is respected even
    when the toolkit automatically scales the asset for the device. (LP:
    #1130120)
  * Added documentation for bitmap suffixes in the resolution
    independence page. (LP: #1092051)
  * Revamped component showcase now called 'Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery'.
    Works on Ubuntu Touch. (LP: #1130603)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Added ListItem.ValueSelector example. Fixed incorrect 'Multi value'
    label. (LP: #1172663)
  * Toolkit Gallery: added examples for Sheets.
  * Automatic rotation of applications depending on the device
    orientation. For applications that are using MainView, they opt-in
    by setting 'automaticOrientation' to true. New component
    OrientationHelper for applications that do not use MainView but
    still need an easy way to automatically rotate.
  * UbuntuShape: fix slight distortion of image when set. This
    distortion was quite disturbing when the content has text in it, as
    it is often the case in Popups and Popovers. (LP: #1170878)
  * Use standard animation ubuntu snap beat for popups fade in.
  * Removed unnecessary clipping from Tabs, Popover, Dialog and
    MainView.
  * All ListItems: set default contents right and left margins to 2 gu.
    ListItems Base, Standard and ValueSelector: deprecated private
    properties __leftIconMargin and __rightIconMargin IconVisual
    (private): removed properties leftIconMargin and rightIconMargin
    Standard: removed ugly progression highlight background when there
    is no split.
  * ListItems: constrain size of the icon by default. Deprecated private
    properties __iconWidth and __iconHeight.
  * Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery tweaks: - Made window wider and left
    column the width of the phone: 40gu. - Removed 'slider.' from Slider
    example's labels. - Renamed 'Switches' into 'Toggles'. Renamed
    'Progress Bars' into 'Progress and activity'. - Use resolution
    independence for navigation example screenshots.
  * Support source with quotes in .sci files. (LP: #1080719)
  * Reverted unjustified changes to ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.desktop.
  * Popover: simplified computation of height: - contentHeight to be the
    height of the content not of the delegate - delegate to always be
    the height of the Popover. (LP: #1178227)
  * New UbuntuAnimation durations and easing constants. New
    UbuntuNumberAnimation.
  * Document type for alias properties of the following classes: -
    TextArea - TextField - ListItems.Empty - ListItems.SingleValue -
    Popups.Dialog - Popups.Popover - Popups.SheetBase. (LP: #1169919)
  * Added new API to retrieve command line arguments: Arguments.
  * Reduced size of the x-large font size per design.

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * Fix autopilot tests and add autopilot package. (LP: #1169556) (LP:
    #1170659) This branch makes the five autopilot tests to run again
    with newest autopilot packages, and adds a ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    autopilot package to install for CI or other purposes. The tests are
    runnable both from an installed package or source directory. (LP:
    #1170659, #1169556)
  * autopilot: Switch mouse -> pointing_device for phablet-test-run (LP:
    #1175363). (LP: #1175363)
  * Remove one old rename transition, add a new one, add the split
    plugins dependency. The split multimedia plugins only as recommends
    to be on the safe side during the transition period to 5.0.2.
  * Port to autopilot 1.3 and update test content to match UI.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev from ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot, as long as
    dpkg-architecture is used.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)
  * qmlrunner for archs amd64 i386 armhf instead of any.
  * Add python dependency and use the python command explicitly to fix
    FTBFS. (LP: #1183198). (LP: #1183198)
  * Use dpkg-architecture instead of '*' for qmlrunner's symlinks.
    Something has broken the latter recently and dpkg-architecture is
    more trustworthy anyway.

  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * Add a base URL to qdocconf file. (LP: #1175389)
  * Introduce QML API check; if API changes, check components.api.new.
  * Refer checkbox docs to design guide. (LP: #1174958)
  * Use offline documentation as a basis for online docs. (LP: #1183013)
  * Save qdoc error log and fail if it's not empty. (LP: #1185402)

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Workaround for TextArea and TextField removing OSK when active focus
    is transferred from one instance to another using focus property. .
    (LP: #1163371)
  * Fixing disabled text input delegate background color theming when
    userValue is set to TextField or TextArea color property. (LP:
    #1169601)
  * Fix for text inputs staying disabled after being re-enabled. The
    previous workaround for removing input panel was blocking re-
    enabling a previously enabled input. (LP: #1164634)
  * Fix for auto expanding TextArea eating flick events from Flickables.
    (LP: #1144077)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Memory leak fixes lost from a previous MR.
  * [theming] Building selector for a styled item moved into Selector
    class. Previous functionality present in
    ItemStyleAttachedPrivate::updateStyleSelector() was moved into
    Selector class, class being responsible of building up the selectors
    from different sources. A selector can now be built up from a
    QQuickItem, in which case the item becomes the owner of the
    selector. Any additional update on the selector made by calling
    update() method will fetch the latest information from the owner and
    update the last node of the selector.
  * [theming] Style update optimization. - updateCurrentStyle() renamed
    to updateTheme() - resetStyle() ad resetDelegate() removed from
    updateStyle() and updateDelegate() respectively to avoid unnecessary
    calls on reset - updateTheme() checks whether the style rule has
    been changed, and compares whether style objects are different in
    the new style rule (this second part is more like prerequisite for
    an upcomming delegate detection MR) - setName() and setStyleClass()
    doe snot update the entire styleSelector - setName() and
    setStyleClass() apply styling changes on children -
    updateStyleSelector() became redundant, removed.
  * Fixing crash on custom style objects previously owned by other
    styled items. (LP: #1168006)
  * Unit converter example updated to use the latest UITK components.
  * [theming] Cache delegates separately from style objects and store
    the style object and the delegate type string in the style rule. In
    this way the theme engine can sort out unnecessary re-creation of
    delegates on a styled item when the style rule on the styled item
    gets changed and the previous and the new style rules share the same
    delegate component.
  * [theming] ItemStyle attached object detects now the time when the
    first styled item's attached component gets completed. In this way
    first time style object and delegate creation can be moved from re-
    parenting to completion.
  * Fix for crash in theme engine when loading application specific
    theme file in an app having a Popover instantiated. (LP: #1175394)
  * [theming] Removing deprecated functionality.
  * [theming] Changing stateful libraries to stateless to decrease time
    spent each time Ubuntu.Components module is imported. (LP: #1170638)
  * [theming] FontUtils converted from stateful JS library to native
    module due to its dependency to "units" context property.
  * [inversemaousearea] Fixing sensingArea not updated on phablet. (LP:
    #1166127)
  * InverseMouseArea sensingArea and Popovers' dismissArea works now
    when included in Window. (LP: #1182673)
  * [inversemousearea] Default sensing area not set on the proper time.
    (LP: #1185397)

  [ Juhapekka Piiroinen ]
  * Added missing QML2_IMPORT_PATH to unit test runner script.
  * Add a new Panel component that can be swiped in and out from an edge
    of the window by the user. As opposed to the default toolbar (which
    inherits from the Panel), a Panel can be attached to any edge of the
    screen, and the developer is free to define its contents. For
    standard cases, the automatic toolbar from the MainView and Page can
    still be used. API changes: * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool
    active TO property bool opened * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool
    lock TO property bool locked * CHANGED IN ToolbarActions: property
    bool active TO property bool opened * CHANGED IN ToolbarActions:
    property bool lock TO property bool locked. (LP: #1131209, #1116578,
    #1163395)
  * Adds Help file for Qt Creator usage. After this you can access
    documentation using F1.
  * Fix rules for qch files.
  * Build qch on qmake execution.
  * Fixes bug #1176132 [i18n] Set up the translation domain
    automatically Sets i18n.domain = applicationName on
    MainView::onApplicationNameChanged. (LP: #1176132)
  * Added depends for the docs install target. (LP: #1187006)
  * Improving autopilot tests.
  * Fix runtest.sh, it was missing xml argument on fallback execution.
    Removed testparser execution Added README file for unit tests. Added
    new targets: make test-performance <= runs performance tests make
    test-components <= runs functional tests for components make test-
    api <= runs api tests for components.
  * Fix failing textarea autopilot test by commenting out textarea tests
    for now.

  [ Olivier Tilloy ]
  * Added property TextField.inputMethodHints. (LP: #1185392)
  * When the clear button is not visible, ensure the text can use its
    space. (LP: #1186247)

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * enable horizontalAlignment for TextField and make the hint text
    follow its properties .

  [ tpeeters ]
  * Disable swiping to switch tabs by default. This is a preparation for
    the complete removal of the swipe-to-switch-tabs functionality cf.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/+bug/1166709.
  * Disable events on disabled controls inside list items. (LP:

  * Add a new Panel component that can be swiped in and out from an edge

    of deprecated properties.
  * Fix small documentation errors. (LP: #1174985)

    Repeater to define the tabs. (LP: #1167568, #1096969, #1166709,
    #1124065)
  * Extend ActionList API so that Actions can be re-used by toolbars on
    multiple Pages. (LP: #1122864)
  * fix error in documentation of Action.
  * Combine the propagated properties of PageTreeNode in a single
    property propagated that contains all the other properties.
  * documentation fix.
  * Remove preliminary and deprecated HUD integration. Internal __hud
    property removed from MainView. (LP: #1129966)
  * Generate documentation for i18n. (LP: #1078631)
  * Add a test program that shows panels on different edges of the
    application view to tests/resources/toolbar. Like the other test
    programs in resources, this will come in handy for testing changes
    to the components.
  * revert changes to PageWrapperUtils.jp from revision 501 because it
    breaks phone-app. (LP: #1183456)
  * Properly internalize PageTreeNode's propagated property and tweak
    header behavior so that propagated.header does not need to be used
    by any of the apps: - CHANGED IN PageTreeNode: propagated TO
    __propagated - CHANGED IN Tabs: Automatically show the header when
    the title of the active tab changes - CHANGED IN Page/MainView: Only
    enable auto-hide behavior of header when the Page's flickable can be
    flicked vertically, so that manual setting of anchors is no longer
    needed for flickables that only flick horizontally (calendar-app).

ubuntu-ui-toolkit (0.1.37) raring; urgency=low

  * Compatibility Breaks
    - Page, PageStack and Tabs automatically determine their anchors and height
      inside a MainView, so there is no need to set them explicitly.
    - It is now recommended to always use Pages inside Tabs or PageStack.
      Non-Page items can still be used, but their margins will not automatically
      be set-up to align with the header of the MainView.
  * API Changes (LP: #1157191)
    - Property tools was deprecated for MainView, Tabs and PageStack. Pages now automatically
      update MainView.toolbar.tools when they become active.
    - Property page of Tab can no longer be a URL, but must be an Item (Page recommended).
      Use a Loader if you were using a URL first.
