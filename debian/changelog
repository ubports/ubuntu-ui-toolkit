  * Move to use QQmlExtensionPlugin::baseUrl(), remove workaround. 
    Prerequisite for transitioning to proper QML singleton use and

  * Revert Icon10 change from header animations MR to fix coloring

    it is easier to modify them individually and to execute them with
    qmlscene for testing. 
  * Ensure active and current pages are always updated in the same 
    order in PageStack.
  * Update qml files in tests/resources.

  [ Lars Uebernickel ]
  * unitythemeiconprovider: manually load icons
    Previously, UnityThemeIconProvider used QIcon::fromTheme() to 
    lookup and load icons. That function uses fdo's default icon 
    lookup algorithm: it looks at the current theme and all parent
    themes for each icon in turn. We'd prefer a breadth-first search,
    where all icon names are looked up in the current theme before 
    falling back to the parent themes. This change implements fdo's 
    FindBestIcon() algorithm, which behaves like that.
    It also now properly support rectangular icons and always returns
    an icon with the requested size (adjusted for preserving the 
    aspect ratio).
    As a result, the Icon component is much simpler and only requires 
    height to be set for rectangular icons. Fixes LP: #1324184

    - left mouse button press and drag selects the text
    - text can be scrolled with mouse wheel and scrollbar only

    (.qmltheme file), only delegates remain. A theme is a QML module
    containing delegates whose names are standardized. The default theme
    is called 'Ambiance' and available from QML through 'import
    Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance 0.1'. The name of the current
    theme is set in ~/.config/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/theme.ini Writing a new
    theme is done by creating a QML module and adding it in the
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes folder. A theme inherits from another theme
    by containing a text file name 'parent_theme' whose first and only
    line is the name of the parent theme. * Moved themes/ directory to
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes so that themes are importable. * Simplified
    ThemeEngine and ThemeSettings class, removed the rest of the theming
    infrastructure (ItemStyle, Style, QmlThemeLoader, Selector,
    StyleCache). * Adapted all widgets to use the simplified theming
    technique: - new StyledItem class that has a 'style' Component
    property representing the delegate - all widgets that have delegates
    inherit from StyledItem - all widgets set the 'style' property to
    the corresponding delegate in the current theme by using
    Theme.createStyleComponent() - Ambiance's stylesheet property/values
    have been moved to where they are used (mostly to the delegates) -
    TextAreaDelegate: exposed background as Component property - Added a
    delegate specific to TextField: TextFieldDelegate - Renamed
    delegates so that they match their widget's name (e.g.
    EditorCursorDelegate.qml renamed to TextCursorDelegate.qml since
    it's the delegate of TextCursor.qml) * Renamed UITK_THEME_PATH into
    UBUNTU_UI_TOOLKIT_THEMES_PATH. (LP: #1152160, #1152161, #1152162,
    #1185950, #1081038, #1167998, #1137210, #1152154, #1152158)
  * New UbuntuColors singleton defining the standard Ubuntu color
    palette. (LP: #1098209)
  * debian/control: specify same architecture for ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    theme as for qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin so that the
    files end up in the same folder. (LP: #1197164)
  * Button: - implementation clean up - updated visual design - new
    'gradient' property.
  * When looking up the plugin's directory
    (UbuntuComponentsPlugin::baseUrl), a case was omitted: if another
    Ubuntu/Components directory exists and is present in the
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH then the lookup failed. This fix is temporary until
    Qt 5.1. (LP: #1197293)
  * Reverted revisions 562 & 569 that broke the autopilot tests. Fixed
    button related autopilot test. (LP: #1197355)

  * [UbuntuShape] Correctly stored the current material. (LP: #1132771)
  * [UbuntuShape] Ensured the texture is available in updatePaintNode().
    (LP: #1171437)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * QML_IMPORT_PATH is deprecated for QtQuick 2.0. Switch to
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH.
  * Added syntax description for CHANGES file in CHANGES.syntax.
  * UCScalingImageProvider: respect 'requestedSize' parameter. That
    ensures that the 'sourceSize' property of Image is respected even
    when the toolkit automatically scales the asset for the device. (LP:
    #1130120)
  * Added documentation for bitmap suffixes in the resolution
    independence page. (LP: #1092051)
  * Revamped component showcase now called 'Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery'.
    Works on Ubuntu Touch. (LP: #1130603)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Added ListItem.ValueSelector example. Fixed incorrect 'Multi value'
    label. (LP: #1172663)
  * Toolkit Gallery: added examples for Sheets.
  * Automatic rotation of applications depending on the device
    orientation. For applications that are using MainView, they opt-in
    by setting 'automaticOrientation' to true. New component
    OrientationHelper for applications that do not use MainView but
    still need an easy way to automatically rotate.
  * UbuntuShape: fix slight distortion of image when set. This
    distortion was quite disturbing when the content has text in it, as
    it is often the case in Popups and Popovers. (LP: #1170878)
  * Use standard animation ubuntu snap beat for popups fade in.
  * Removed unnecessary clipping from Tabs, Popover, Dialog and
    MainView.
  * All ListItems: set default contents right and left margins to 2 gu.
    ListItems Base, Standard and ValueSelector: deprecated private
    properties __leftIconMargin and __rightIconMargin IconVisual
    (private): removed properties leftIconMargin and rightIconMargin
    Standard: removed ugly progression highlight background when there
    is no split.
  * ListItems: constrain size of the icon by default. Deprecated private
    properties __iconWidth and __iconHeight.
  * Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery tweaks: - Made window wider and left
    column the width of the phone: 40gu. - Removed 'slider.' from Slider
    example's labels. - Renamed 'Switches' into 'Toggles'. Renamed
    'Progress Bars' into 'Progress and activity'. - Use resolution
    independence for navigation example screenshots.
  * Support source with quotes in .sci files. (LP: #1080719)
  * Reverted unjustified changes to ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.desktop.
  * Popover: simplified computation of height: - contentHeight to be the
    height of the content not of the delegate - delegate to always be
    the height of the Popover. (LP: #1178227)
  * New UbuntuAnimation durations and easing constants. New
    UbuntuNumberAnimation.

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * Fix autopilot tests and add autopilot package. (LP: #1169556) (LP:
    #1170659) This branch makes the five autopilot tests to run again
    with newest autopilot packages, and adds a ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    autopilot package to install for CI or other purposes. The tests are
    runnable both from an installed package or source directory. (LP:
    #1170659, #1169556)
  * autopilot: Switch mouse -> pointing_device for phablet-test-run (LP:
    #1175363). (LP: #1175363)
  * Remove one old rename transition, add a new one, add the split
    plugins dependency. The split multimedia plugins only as recommends
    to be on the safe side during the transition period to 5.0.2.
  * Port to autopilot 1.3 and update test content to match UI.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev from ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot, as long as
    dpkg-architecture is used.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)
  * qmlrunner for archs amd64 i386 armhf instead of any.
  * Add python dependency and use the python command explicitly to fix
    FTBFS. (LP: #1183198). (LP: #1183198)
  * Use dpkg-architecture instead of '*' for qmlrunner's symlinks.
    Something has broken the latter recently and dpkg-architecture is
    more trustworthy anyway.

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Workaround for TextArea and TextField removing OSK when active focus
    is transferred from one instance to another using focus property. .
    (LP: #1163371)
  * Fixing disabled text input delegate background color theming when
    userValue is set to TextField or TextArea color property. (LP:
    #1169601)
  * Fix for text inputs staying disabled after being re-enabled. The
    previous workaround for removing input panel was blocking re-
    enabling a previously enabled input. (LP: #1164634)
  * Fix for auto expanding TextArea eating flick events from Flickables.
    (LP: #1144077)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Memory leak fixes lost from a previous MR.
  * [theming] Building selector for a styled item moved into Selector
    class. Previous functionality present in
    ItemStyleAttachedPrivate::updateStyleSelector() was moved into
    Selector class, class being responsible of building up the selectors
    from different sources. A selector can now be built up from a
    QQuickItem, in which case the item becomes the owner of the
    selector. Any additional update on the selector made by calling
    update() method will fetch the latest information from the owner and
    update the last node of the selector.
  * [theming] Style update optimization. - updateCurrentStyle() renamed
    to updateTheme() - resetStyle() ad resetDelegate() removed from
    updateStyle() and updateDelegate() respectively to avoid unnecessary
    calls on reset - updateTheme() checks whether the style rule has
    been changed, and compares whether style objects are different in
    the new style rule (this second part is more like prerequisite for
    an upcomming delegate detection MR) - setName() and setStyleClass()
    doe snot update the entire styleSelector - setName() and
    setStyleClass() apply styling changes on children -
    updateStyleSelector() became redundant, removed.
  * Fixing crash on custom style objects previously owned by other
    styled items. (LP: #1168006)
  * Unit converter example updated to use the latest UITK components.
  * [theming] Cache delegates separately from style objects and store
    the style object and the delegate type string in the style rule. In
    this way the theme engine can sort out unnecessary re-creation of
    delegates on a styled item when the style rule on the styled item
    gets changed and the previous and the new style rules share the same
    delegate component.
  * [theming] ItemStyle attached object detects now the time when the
    first styled item's attached component gets completed. In this way
    first time style object and delegate creation can be moved from re-
    parenting to completion.
  * Fix for crash in theme engine when loading application specific
    theme file in an app having a Popover instantiated. (LP: #1175394)
  * [theming] Removing deprecated functionality.
  * [theming] Changing stateful libraries to stateless to decrease time
    spent each time Ubuntu.Components module is imported. (LP: #1170638)
  * [theming] FontUtils converted from stateful JS library to native
    module due to its dependency to "units" context property.
  * [inversemaousearea] Fixing sensingArea not updated on phablet. (LP:
    #1166127)
  * InverseMouseArea sensingArea and Popovers' dismissArea works now
    when included in Window. (LP: #1182673)
  * [inversemousearea] Default sensing area not set on the proper time.
    (LP: #1185397)

  [ Juhapekka Piiroinen ]
  * Added missing QML2_IMPORT_PATH to unit test runner script.
  * Add a new Panel component that can be swiped in and out from an edge
    of the window by the user. As opposed to the default toolbar (which
    inherits from the Panel), a Panel can be attached to any edge of the
    screen, and the developer is free to define its contents. For
    standard cases, the automatic toolbar from the MainView and Page can
    still be used. API changes: * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool

  * Compatibility Breaks
    - Page, PageStack and Tabs automatically determine their anchors and height
      inside a MainView, so there is no need to set them explicitly.
    - It is now recommended to always use Pages inside Tabs or PageStack.
      Non-Page items can still be used, but their margins will not automatically
      be set-up to align with the header of the MainView.
  * API Changes (LP: #1157191)
    - Property tools was deprecated for MainView, Tabs and PageStack. Pages now automatically
      update MainView.toolbar.tools when they become active.
    - Property page of Tab can no longer be a URL, but must be an Item (Page recommended).
      Use a Loader if you were using a URL first.
