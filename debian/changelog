  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * Added public headers extra robustness checks. Made use of the qmake
    headersclean feature to check the robustness of our public headers.
  * Excluded LTTng features from non-Linux builds.
  * Moved common C++ configs to ubuntu_common.prf. The common config file
    doesn't add -Werror directly to QMAKE_CXXFLAGS anymore, it sets the
    warnings_are_errors variable so that it is correctly handled by different
    compilers (not just GCC). That allows to remove the
    -Werror=deprecated-declarations flag since warnings_are_errors defines it
    for us. Removed the DEFINES += QT_USE_QSTRINGBUILDER lines since it's
    already handled by qt_module.prf. Set the -Wsuggest-override warning to
    QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_WARN_ON instead of QMAKE_CXXFLAGS directly.
  * Cleaned up qmake Ubuntu packaging variables. The qtbase packaging for Ubuntu
    exports the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LFLAGS variables in the environment before
    running configure so that the qtbase shared libraries can be compiled with
    the required distribution defined compiler flags. That is fine (though I
    guess that could be handled better at the qtbase packaging level with maybe
    a dedicated prf) but it results in qt_build_config.prf defining the
    QMAKE_CFLAGS, QMAKE_CXXFLAGS and QMAKE_LFLAGS variables with these
    distribution specific flags. Since we load this prf, these variables end up
    being defined when building the toolkit for development purpose. This is
    problematic because -O2 and -g are always defined (whatever the debug or
    release config chosen by the developer), also these are GCC specific flags
    which makes our build break with other compilers. This is also ugly because
    preprocessor defines are directly set in the QMAKE_C*FLAGS. In order to
    workaround these issues, we unset these variables and set the different
    flags apart from -g and -O2 in the right qmake variables. This allows to
    keep compiling with the Debian flags but in a more flexible way. For the
    Debian packaging, we keep the former behaviour by simply passing the
    debian_build config.
  * Optimised QString code gen for ASCII strings known at compile-time. That
    allows the compiler to optimise our code better by putting all these
    QStrings known at compile time in the .rodata section of the binary as well
    as preventing a bunch of useless processing on them. That also allows us to
    remove "DEFINES -= QT_ASCII_CAST_WARNINGS" from the UbuntuToolkit pro file.

  * Make ActivityIndicator spinner blue instead of orange. Fixes: LP: #1577828.

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * Changed src/ directory layout. Made the source directory layout consistent
    with Qt libs. The C++ libraries have been moved to src/ and the QML modules
    to src/imports/. That also makes it easier to differentiate between modules
    and libraries since we have a bunch of them now.
  * Moved internal tools meant to generate code for the toolkit lib from the QML
    module directory to the lib directory where it makes more sense.
  * Fixed the build as a Qt submodule.
  * Fixed, cleaned up and standardised header inclusions. Apart from the clean
    up and the readability improvements, this fixes a bunch of broken private
    header inclusions (#include "foo_p.h" in private headers instead of
    "private/foo_p.h" or better ), now all the private headers of the UITK can
    be included by the users withour compilation issues. It also removes a bunch
    of direct includes from sources and a few INCLUDEPATHs hacks.See the CODING
    file for more details.
  * Cleaned up ubuntu_qt_module.prf and the libs using it.
    1/ Moved the common config options from the pro files to the prf file to
       avoid duplications and simplify the files.
    2/ Removed the useless "TEMPLATE=lib" and "load(qt_build_config)" lines from
       the pro files since it's done for us by qt_module.prf.
    3/ Use QT= instead of QT*= since it's well defined that by default its
       content is "core gui".
    4/ Prefixed headers and sources by $$PWD/ and sorted the lines
       alphabetically.
    5/ Merged the SOURCES declarations in UbuntuToolkit.pro.
    6/ Removed the useless "DEFINES += QT_USE_QSTRINGBUILDER" line from
       UbuntuToolkit.pro since it's done for us by qt_module.prf.
    7/ Removed the useless "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS -= -Werror=deprecated-declarations"
       and "DEFINES -= QT_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS" lines from UbuntuToolkit.pro
       since it's already done in ubuntu_qt_module.prf.
    8/ Added a few comments.
  * Made use of Qt builtin to check GCC version.

  [ Tim Peeters ]
  * Improve the initialization of Action when it gets both iconName and
    iconSource from an external component when iconSource is undefined. This
    fixes the some times missing overflow button in the ActionBar with Qt 5.6.
    I also removed action: modelData from the OverflowPanel because this is
    already set automatically in ActionSelectionPopover after everything is
    initialized. That fixes a ReferenceError in OverflowPanel with Qt 5.6.
    Fixes: LP: #1616858.
  * Use the new arrow icons from the suru-icon-theme in the scrolling ActionBar.

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * UbuntuShape - Use reference counting to handle shape textures.
    The current shape textures handling system requires to search for the
    textures associated to the current graphics context by doing a search in an
    array for each item at each updatePaintNode() call. It also deletes the
    textures on OpenGLContext::aboutToBeDestroyed() signal emission, which
    appears in some cases to not have any OpenGL context bound.
    We propose an alternative to create and destroy shape textures per material
    creation and destruction with a reference counting mechanism to minimise
    costly calls. We search for the shape textures (hash lookup with an OpenGL
    context pointer as the key) only when a texture material is created or
    deleted, which is much more occasional compared to updatePaintNode() calls.
    That also ensures textures are deleted with the proper OpenGL context bound.
    The only drawback is that shape textures are deleted when there is no shape
    items anymore in a scene and recreated when there is a new one appearing.
    These operations being quite uncommon and relatively fast, the advantages
    seem to be higher than the drawbacks.
  * Expansion of LD_LIBRARY_PATH is broken since it doesn't include a ":", which

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * UbuntuShape - Added support drop shadow aspect support to UbuntuShapeOverlay
    Fixes LP: #1480197.
  * UbuntuShape - Removed content orientation work around.
    The shape was using a workaround to make it render correctly when the
    content orientation was not the native one. This was perfect for the
    OrientationHelper shipped with the toolkit but now that the Shell
    implements the rotation, this is not needed anymore and causes some
    rendering issues. Note that the shape will still needs to support
    correct rendering when rotated using the rotation property of the Item,
    but that is a different issue. Fixes LP: #1466656.

  * QQmlContextData.url is a method in 5.5.0. Fixes LP: #1461897.
  * OrientationHelper shouldn't move depending on availableHeight. The
    parentChanged/availableHeight change in OrientationHelper is the bug fix
    itself. The new property UbuntuApplication.inputMethod defaults to
    Qt.inputMethod and the unit test overrides it to reproduce the bug (fix)
    regardless of device and input method setup - the mock keyboard is NOT
    expected to be fully functional, buttons are but a placeholder irrelevant

  [ Albert Astals Cid ]
  * Adapt to behaviour change in handling of QVariants from QML to
    C++ in Qt 5.4
  * Don't use Qt::PopupFocusReason to change the focus Even if it
    is the correct reason QtQuick is since 5.4 ignoring  focus changes
    due to PopupFocusReason. Fixes LP: #1395014.
  * Fix test failure with Qt 5.4 ExpandablesColumn::test_expandedItem()
    In Qt 5.4 an alias to a null variable is correctly null instead of
    undefined like it was in 5.3, since we still want 5.3 support i'm
    conveting it to a verify with ==  that uses JS loose comparison to
    accept both null and undefined. Fixes LP: #1395012.

  [ Alexandre Abreu ]
  * Remove the unecessary DBUS bindingi to global address
    org.freedesktop.Application by the UriHAndler. It actually fails
    for confined apps and the uri-dispatcher anyway does not work by
    directly calling into the exposed "well known names" exposed on
    the bus as TEd explains here LP: #1342129  but by directly calling
     into the process dbus connection. Fixes LP: #1378823.

  [ Benjamin Zeller ]
  * Fix scripts to work in shadowbuild mode.
  * Shadowbuild support for ubuntu-ui-toolkit.

  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * Abort export_modules_dir.sh and ergo run_tests.sh if binaries are
    absent. Fixes LP: #1415973.
  * Asterisk are needed for cp -R.
  * Ensure adb is running (and fallback arch if dpkg-dev is missing).
    Fixes LP: #1417997.
  * Get arch for push_to_phone.sh from device and handle adb refusal.
  * Implement and unit-test i18n.(c)tag. Fixes LP: #1417031.
  * Print component creation errors in popupUtils.open.
    Fixes LP: #1418507.
  * Use correct unfocussed text field color. Fixes LP: #1396062.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Refactor OrientationHelper Simplify animation code and make it
    more robust. It now survives changes in Screen.primaryOrientation
    and Screen.orientation happening one right after the other.

  [ Daniel Holbach ]
  * Fix broken link to developer site.

  [ Giulio Collura ]
  * This is a bugfix for bug LP: #1341814 and bug LP: #1400297.
    Essentially we have to force the removal of the previous
    'contents' item by removing its parent. This way we ensure that
    the contents are correctly hidden, focused and removed, without
    destroying them.

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * Removed unused variables breaking debug builds.

  [ Michael Sheldon ]
  * Only use stableOrientationAngleTimer in the OrientationHelper when
    the orientationAngle has been set automatically.
    Fixes LP: #1409027.

  [ Niklas Wenzel ]
  *  Fixes LP: #1395118

  [ nskaggs ]
  * Re-add autopilot helper documentation and update. Fixes
    LP: #1409778, LP: #1410477.

  [ Tim Peeters ]
  * Add a preview of the new list items to the UITK component gallery.
  * Add performance test for MainView.
  * Clean python code to follow pep257 standards.
  * Fix incorrect header contents width when navigating back from a
    page with a lot of actions. Fixes LP: #1408481.
  * Split up MainView in MainView and MainViewBase. Move docs to
    MainView.qdoc.
  * Use objectName for the MainViews in our autopilot tests.

  [ Zoltán Balogh ]
  * Added Dialog CPO to test if OSK pushes up the the dialog.
  * Update the test plan and fix the PPA string in case it contains
    backslash.

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * CPOs
  * Include ServiceProperties component into the module and the
    missing test case - inclusion messed up due to broken mainline in
    the previous branch. Fixes LP: #1391877.
  * Introducing action property in ListItem.
    Fixes LP: #1362305, LP: #1369935.
  * Introducing pressAndHold signal into ListItem.
  * ListItem highlight is driven also by the connection of a slot to
    the clicked() signal. This will also be applied when pressAndHold
    signal will be introduced. Fixes LP: #1399025.
  * Small refactoring to follow upstream concept on naming attached
    properties. Panels visualising ListItemActions are owned by
    ListItem and not being shared by the ListItemActiomns. In this way
    the same ListItemActions instance can be used on both leading and
    trailing side. Fixes LP: #1403005.

  * This is needed by unity8 for the "shell rotation" feature (ie
    shell does all the rotation work instead of apps rotating
    themselves). unity8's dialogs (like the power dialog when you
    long press the power button) should follow its parent item
    rotation and size, as one would expect, and not be sneakily
    reparented to the scene root item, in which case the shell
    UI would be rotated but its dialog would not.

  * Use proper QML Singleton structure introduced in Qt 5.2.
  * Move to use QQmlExtensionPlugin::baseUrl(), remove workaround.
    Prerequisite for transitioning to proper QML singleton use and
    new ListItem.
  * Focus should not be taken by a component if disabled. Complete
    child filtering properly.
  * Organizer audible reminder was not updated when Alarm sound

  * Handle singleton in qmldir and explicitly skip unknown keywords.

  [ Tim Peeters ]
  * Revert Icon10 change from header animations MR to fix coloring
    of icons.
  * Update tabs AP tests. By moving the qml code in separate files,
    it is easier to modify them individually and to execute them with
    qmlscene for testing.
  * Ensure active and current pages are always updated in the same
    order in PageStack.
  * Update qml files in tests/resources.

  [ Lars Uebernickel ]
  * unitythemeiconprovider: manually load icons
    Previously, UnityThemeIconProvider used QIcon::fromTheme() to
    lookup and load icons. That function uses fdo's default icon
    lookup algorithm: it looks at the current theme and all parent
    themes for each icon in turn. We'd prefer a breadth-first search,
    where all icon names are looked up in the current theme before
    falling back to the parent themes. This change implements fdo's
    FindBestIcon() algorithm, which behaves like that.
    It also now properly support rectangular icons and always returns
    an icon with the requested size (adjusted for preserving the
    aspect ratio).
    As a result, the Icon component is much simpler and only requires
    height to be set for rectangular icons. Fixes LP: #1324184

    containing delegates whose names are standardized. The default theme
    is called 'Ambiance' and available from QML through 'import

    theme is set in ~/.config/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/theme.ini Writing a new
    theme is done by creating a QML module and adding it in the

    by containing a text file name 'parent_theme' whose first and only
    line is the name of the parent theme. * Moved themes/ directory to

    ThemeEngine and ThemeSettings class, removed the rest of the theming
    infrastructure (ItemStyle, Style, QmlThemeLoader, Selector,
    StyleCache). * Adapted all widgets to use the simplified theming
    technique: - new StyledItem class that has a 'style' Component
    property representing the delegate - all widgets that have delegates
    inherit from StyledItem - all widgets set the 'style' property to
    the corresponding delegate in the current theme by using
    Theme.createStyleComponent() - Ambiance's stylesheet property/values
    have been moved to where they are used (mostly to the delegates) -
    TextAreaDelegate: exposed background as Component property - Added a
    delegate specific to TextField: TextFieldDelegate - Renamed
    delegates so that they match their widget's name (e.g.
    EditorCursorDelegate.qml renamed to TextCursorDelegate.qml since
    it's the delegate of TextCursor.qml) * Renamed UITK_THEME_PATH into
    UBUNTU_UI_TOOLKIT_THEMES_PATH. (LP: #1152160, #1152161, #1152162,
    #1185950, #1081038, #1167998, #1137210, #1152154, #1152158)
  * New UbuntuColors singleton defining the standard Ubuntu color
    palette. (LP: #1098209)
  * debian/control: specify same architecture for ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    theme as for qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin so that the
    files end up in the same folder. (LP: #1197164)
  * Button: - implementation clean up - updated visual design - new
    'gradient' property.
  * When looking up the plugin's directory
    (UbuntuComponentsPlugin::baseUrl), a case was omitted: if another
    Ubuntu/Components directory exists and is present in the
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH then the lookup failed. This fix is temporary until
    Qt 5.1. (LP: #1197293)
  * Reverted revisions 562 & 569 that broke the autopilot tests. Fixed
    button related autopilot test. (LP: #1197355)

  * Add qttools5-dev-tools to build dependencies to provide
    qhelpgenerator for creating QtC help files from documentation.
  * Build documentation and publish the qch file.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * [UbuntuShape] Correctly stored the current material. (LP: #1132771)
  * [UbuntuShape] Ensured the texture is available in updatePaintNode().
    (LP: #1171437)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * QML_IMPORT_PATH is deprecated for QtQuick 2.0. Switch to
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH.
  * Added syntax description for CHANGES file in CHANGES.syntax.
  * UCScalingImageProvider: respect 'requestedSize' parameter. That
    ensures that the 'sourceSize' property of Image is respected even
    when the toolkit automatically scales the asset for the device. (LP:
    #1130120)
  * Added documentation for bitmap suffixes in the resolution
    independence page. (LP: #1092051)
  * Revamped component showcase now called 'Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery'.
    Works on Ubuntu Touch. (LP: #1130603)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Added ListItem.ValueSelector example. Fixed incorrect 'Multi value'
    label. (LP: #1172663)
  * Toolkit Gallery: added examples for Sheets.
  * Automatic rotation of applications depending on the device
    orientation. For applications that are using MainView, they opt-in
    by setting 'automaticOrientation' to true. New component
    OrientationHelper for applications that do not use MainView but
    still need an easy way to automatically rotate.
  * UbuntuShape: fix slight distortion of image when set. This
    distortion was quite disturbing when the content has text in it, as
    it is often the case in Popups and Popovers. (LP: #1170878)
  * Use standard animation ubuntu snap beat for popups fade in.
  * Removed unnecessary clipping from Tabs, Popover, Dialog and
    MainView.
  * All ListItems: set default contents right and left margins to 2 gu.
    ListItems Base, Standard and ValueSelector: deprecated private
    properties __leftIconMargin and __rightIconMargin IconVisual
    (private): removed properties leftIconMargin and rightIconMargin
    Standard: removed ugly progression highlight background when there
    is no split.
  * ListItems: constrain size of the icon by default. Deprecated private
    properties __iconWidth and __iconHeight.
  * Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery tweaks: - Made window wider and left
    column the width of the phone: 40gu. - Removed 'slider.' from Slider
    example's labels. - Renamed 'Switches' into 'Toggles'. Renamed
    'Progress Bars' into 'Progress and activity'. - Use resolution
    independence for navigation example screenshots.
  * Support source with quotes in .sci files. (LP: #1080719)
  * Reverted unjustified changes to ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.desktop.
  * Popover: simplified computation of height: - contentHeight to be the
    height of the content not of the delegate - delegate to always be
    the height of the Popover. (LP: #1178227)
  * New UbuntuAnimation durations and easing constants. New
    UbuntuNumberAnimation.
  * Document type for alias properties of the following classes: -
    TextArea - TextField - ListItems.Empty - ListItems.SingleValue -
    Popups.Dialog - Popups.Popover - Popups.SheetBase. (LP: #1169919)

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * Fix autopilot tests and add autopilot package. (LP: #1169556) (LP:
    #1170659) This branch makes the five autopilot tests to run again
    with newest autopilot packages, and adds a ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    autopilot package to install for CI or other purposes. The tests are
    runnable both from an installed package or source directory. (LP:
    #1170659, #1169556)
  * autopilot: Switch mouse -> pointing_device for phablet-test-run (LP:
    #1175363). (LP: #1175363)
  * Remove one old rename transition, add a new one, add the split
    plugins dependency. The split multimedia plugins only as recommends
    to be on the safe side during the transition period to 5.0.2.
  * Port to autopilot 1.3 and update test content to match UI.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev from ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot, as long as
    dpkg-architecture is used.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)
  * qmlrunner for archs amd64 i386 armhf instead of any.
  * Add python dependency and use the python command explicitly to fix
    FTBFS. (LP: #1183198). (LP: #1183198)
  * Use dpkg-architecture instead of '*' for qmlrunner's symlinks.
    Something has broken the latter recently and dpkg-architecture is
    more trustworthy anyway.

  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * Add a base URL to qdocconf file. (LP: #1175389)

  * Refer checkbox docs to design guide. (LP: #1174958)

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Workaround for TextArea and TextField removing OSK when active focus
    is transferred from one instance to another using focus property. .
    (LP: #1163371)
  * Fixing disabled text input delegate background color theming when
    userValue is set to TextField or TextArea color property. (LP:
    #1169601)
  * Fix for text inputs staying disabled after being re-enabled. The
    previous workaround for removing input panel was blocking re-
    enabling a previously enabled input. (LP: #1164634)
  * Fix for auto expanding TextArea eating flick events from Flickables.
    (LP: #1144077)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Memory leak fixes lost from a previous MR.
  * [theming] Building selector for a styled item moved into Selector
    class. Previous functionality present in
    ItemStyleAttachedPrivate::updateStyleSelector() was moved into
    Selector class, class being responsible of building up the selectors
    from different sources. A selector can now be built up from a
    QQuickItem, in which case the item becomes the owner of the
    selector. Any additional update on the selector made by calling
    update() method will fetch the latest information from the owner and
    update the last node of the selector.
  * [theming] Style update optimization. - updateCurrentStyle() renamed
    to updateTheme() - resetStyle() ad resetDelegate() removed from
    updateStyle() and updateDelegate() respectively to avoid unnecessary
    calls on reset - updateTheme() checks whether the style rule has
    been changed, and compares whether style objects are different in
    the new style rule (this second part is more like prerequisite for
    an upcomming delegate detection MR) - setName() and setStyleClass()
    doe snot update the entire styleSelector - setName() and
    setStyleClass() apply styling changes on children -
    updateStyleSelector() became redundant, removed.
  * Fixing crash on custom style objects previously owned by other
    styled items. (LP: #1168006)
  * Unit converter example updated to use the latest UITK components.
  * [theming] Cache delegates separately from style objects and store
    the style object and the delegate type string in the style rule. In
    this way the theme engine can sort out unnecessary re-creation of
    delegates on a styled item when the style rule on the styled item
    gets changed and the previous and the new style rules share the same
    delegate component.
  * [theming] ItemStyle attached object detects now the time when the
    first styled item's attached component gets completed. In this way
    first time style object and delegate creation can be moved from re-
    parenting to completion.
  * Fix for crash in theme engine when loading application specific
    theme file in an app having a Popover instantiated. (LP: #1175394)
  * [theming] Removing deprecated functionality.
  * [theming] Changing stateful libraries to stateless to decrease time
    spent each time Ubuntu.Components module is imported. (LP: #1170638)
  * [theming] FontUtils converted from stateful JS library to native
    module due to its dependency to "units" context property.
  * [inversemaousearea] Fixing sensingArea not updated on phablet. (LP:
    #1166127)
  * InverseMouseArea sensingArea and Popovers' dismissArea works now
    when included in Window. (LP: #1182673)
  * [inversemousearea] Default sensing area not set on the proper time.
    (LP: #1185397)

  [ Juhapekka Piiroinen ]
  * Added missing QML2_IMPORT_PATH to unit test runner script.
  * Add a new Panel component that can be swiped in and out from an edge
    of the window by the user. As opposed to the default toolbar (which
    inherits from the Panel), a Panel can be attached to any edge of the
    screen, and the developer is free to define its contents. For
    standard cases, the automatic toolbar from the MainView and Page can
    still be used. API changes: * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool

  * Compatibility Breaks
    - Page, PageStack and Tabs automatically determine their anchors and height
      inside a MainView, so there is no need to set them explicitly.
    - It is now recommended to always use Pages inside Tabs or PageStack.
      Non-Page items can still be used, but their margins will not automatically
      be set-up to align with the header of the MainView.
  * API Changes (LP: #1157191)
    - Property tools was deprecated for MainView, Tabs and PageStack. Pages now automatically
      update MainView.toolbar.tools when they become active.
    - Property page of Tab can no longer be a URL, but must be an Item (Page recommended).
      Use a Loader if you were using a URL first.
