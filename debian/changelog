  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Fix for re-parenting items that are anchor filled to an item in
    default layout.
  * TextField API extended with API left out from TextInput. wrapMode is
    not inlcuded as does not make sense to be used in single line input.
    (LP: #1183265)
  * Calculator example which turns from simple calculator (phone
    portrait mode) into scientific one (phone landscape mode) reflecting
    the use of Ubuntu.Layouts. .
  * Removing common.pri from Layouts.pro and Layouts\plugin.pro causing
    qmake warnings when Ubuntu UI toolkit project is opened in
    QtCreator.

  [ Leo Arias ]
  * Replaced the MainWindow emulator for autopilot tests with a MainView
    emulator that the uses the custom emulator features of autopilot.
  * Added the Toolbar Autopilot emulator. (LP: #1177341)

  [ Juhapekka Piiroinen ]
  * Fixed broken ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qmlproject file, which had an
    invalid value in mainFile field.

  [ tpeeters ]
  * Update header behavior: - Do not automatically hide the header when
    scrolling in a flickable that is not anchored to the top of the
    page. - Automatically show the header when flickable's contentHeight
    becomes less than flickable.height. - Update documentation for
    Page.flickable. (LP: #1156573, #1160175)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * Removed common.pri and coverage.pri files that were cluttering
    QtCreator making it harder to understand the real structure of the
    project. coverage.pri has been transformed into a feature file
    (coverage.prf) which works the same way as before.
  * Removed antiquated TextCustom class.
  * Removed unused old-style tabs delegate.
  * Removed UbuntuShape.qml and transferred code & documentation to
    shapeitem.cpp ShapeItem: renamed baseColor property into color.
  * UbuntuShape: simplified gradient implementation; gradientColor is
    now the same as color by default. .
  * Simplified theming infrastructure. There are no stylesheets anymore
    (.qmltheme file), only delegates remain. A theme is a QML module
    containing delegates whose names are standardized. The default theme
    is called 'Ambiance' and available from QML through 'import
    Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance 0.1'. The name of the current
    theme is set in ~/.config/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/theme.ini Writing a new
    theme is done by creating a QML module and adding it in the
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes folder. A theme inherits from another theme
    by containing a text file name 'parent_theme' whose first and only
    line is the name of the parent theme. * Moved themes/ directory to
    Ubuntu/Components/Themes so that themes are importable. * Simplified
    ThemeEngine and ThemeSettings class, removed the rest of the theming
    infrastructure (ItemStyle, Style, QmlThemeLoader, Selector,
    StyleCache). * Adapted all widgets to use the simplified theming
    technique: - new StyledItem class that has a 'style' Component
    property representing the delegate - all widgets that have delegates
    inherit from StyledItem - all widgets set the 'style' property to
    the corresponding delegate in the current theme by using
    Theme.createStyleComponent() - Ambiance's stylesheet property/values
    have been moved to where they are used (mostly to the delegates) -
    TextAreaDelegate: exposed background as Component property - Added a
    delegate specific to TextField: TextFieldDelegate - Renamed
    delegates so that they match their widget's name (e.g.
    EditorCursorDelegate.qml renamed to TextCursorDelegate.qml since
    it's the delegate of TextCursor.qml) * Renamed UITK_THEME_PATH into
    UBUNTU_UI_TOOLKIT_THEMES_PATH. (LP: #1152160, #1152161, #1152162,
    #1185950, #1081038, #1167998, #1137210, #1152154, #1152158)
  * New UbuntuColors singleton defining the standard Ubuntu color
    palette. (LP: #1098209)
  * debian/control: specify same architecture for ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    theme as for qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-plugin so that the
    files end up in the same folder. (LP: #1197164)
  * Button: - implementation clean up - updated visual design - new
    'gradient' property.
  * When looking up the plugin's directory
    (UbuntuComponentsPlugin::baseUrl), a case was omitted: if another
    Ubuntu/Components directory exists and is present in the
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH then the lookup failed. This fix is temporary until
    Qt 5.1. (LP: #1197293)
  * Reverted revisions 562 & 569 that broke the autopilot tests. Fixed
    button related autopilot test. (LP: #1197355)

ubuntu-ui-toolkit (0.1.46daily13.06.05.1-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Zoltán Balogh ]
  * update the example app for the latest UI Toolkit.
  * A simple app to check few locales.
  * Add qttools5-dev-tools to build dependencies to provide
    qhelpgenerator for creating QtC help files from documentation.
  * Build documentation and publish the qch file.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)

  [ Loïc Molinari ]
  * [UbuntuShape] Correctly stored the current material. (LP: #1132771)
  * [UbuntuShape] Ensured the texture is available in updatePaintNode().
    (LP: #1171437)

  [ Kaleo ]
  * QML_IMPORT_PATH is deprecated for QtQuick 2.0. Switch to
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH.
  * Added syntax description for CHANGES file in CHANGES.syntax.
  * UCScalingImageProvider: respect 'requestedSize' parameter. That
    ensures that the 'sourceSize' property of Image is respected even
    when the toolkit automatically scales the asset for the device. (LP:
    #1130120)
  * Added documentation for bitmap suffixes in the resolution
    independence page. (LP: #1092051)
  * Revamped component showcase now called 'Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery'.
    Works on Ubuntu Touch. (LP: #1130603)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Added ListItem.ValueSelector example. Fixed incorrect 'Multi value'
    label. (LP: #1172663)
  * Toolkit Gallery: added examples for Sheets.
  * Automatic rotation of applications depending on the device
    orientation. For applications that are using MainView, they opt-in
    by setting 'automaticOrientation' to true. New component
    OrientationHelper for applications that do not use MainView but
    still need an easy way to automatically rotate.
  * UbuntuShape: fix slight distortion of image when set. This
    distortion was quite disturbing when the content has text in it, as
    it is often the case in Popups and Popovers. (LP: #1170878)
  * Use standard animation ubuntu snap beat for popups fade in.
  * Removed unnecessary clipping from Tabs, Popover, Dialog and
    MainView.
  * All ListItems: set default contents right and left margins to 2 gu.
    ListItems Base, Standard and ValueSelector: deprecated private
    properties __leftIconMargin and __rightIconMargin IconVisual
    (private): removed properties leftIconMargin and rightIconMargin
    Standard: removed ugly progression highlight background when there
    is no split.
  * ListItems: constrain size of the icon by default. Deprecated private
    properties __iconWidth and __iconHeight.
  * Ubuntu UI Toolkit Gallery tweaks: - Made window wider and left
    column the width of the phone: 40gu. - Removed 'slider.' from Slider
    example's labels. - Renamed 'Switches' into 'Toggles'. Renamed
    'Progress Bars' into 'Progress and activity'. - Use resolution
    independence for navigation example screenshots.
  * Support source with quotes in .sci files. (LP: #1080719)
  * Reverted unjustified changes to ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.desktop.
  * Popover: simplified computation of height: - contentHeight to be the
    height of the content not of the delegate - delegate to always be
    the height of the Popover. (LP: #1178227)
  * New UbuntuAnimation durations and easing constants. New
    UbuntuNumberAnimation.
  * Document type for alias properties of the following classes: -
    TextArea - TextField - ListItems.Empty - ListItems.SingleValue -
    Popups.Dialog - Popups.Popover - Popups.SheetBase. (LP: #1169919)
  * Added new API to retrieve command line arguments: Arguments.
  * Reduced size of the x-large font size per design.

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * Fix autopilot tests and add autopilot package. (LP: #1169556) (LP:
    #1170659) This branch makes the five autopilot tests to run again
    with newest autopilot packages, and adds a ubuntu-ui-toolkit-
    autopilot package to install for CI or other purposes. The tests are
    runnable both from an installed package or source directory. (LP:
    #1170659, #1169556)
  * autopilot: Switch mouse -> pointing_device for phablet-test-run (LP:
    #1175363). (LP: #1175363)
  * Remove one old rename transition, add a new one, add the split
    plugins dependency. The split multimedia plugins only as recommends
    to be on the safe side during the transition period to 5.0.2.
  * Port to autopilot 1.3 and update test content to match UI.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev from ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot, as long as
    dpkg-architecture is used.
  * Offer symlinks for qmlscene via 'qmlrunner' package. See package
    description for usage instructions. (LP: #1155634). (LP: #1155634)
  * qmlrunner for archs amd64 i386 armhf instead of any.
  * Add python dependency and use the python command explicitly to fix
    FTBFS. (LP: #1183198). (LP: #1183198)
  * Use dpkg-architecture instead of '*' for qmlrunner's symlinks.
    Something has broken the latter recently and dpkg-architecture is
    more trustworthy anyway.

  [ Christian Dywan ]
  * Add a base URL to qdocconf file. (LP: #1175389)
  * Introduce QML API check; if API changes, check components.api.new.
  * Refer checkbox docs to design guide. (LP: #1174958)
  * Use offline documentation as a basis for online docs. (LP: #1183013)
  * Save qdoc error log and fail if it's not empty. (LP: #1185402)

  [ Zsombor Egri ]
  * Workaround for TextArea and TextField removing OSK when active focus
    is transferred from one instance to another using focus property. .
    (LP: #1163371)
  * Fixing disabled text input delegate background color theming when
    userValue is set to TextField or TextArea color property. (LP:
    #1169601)
  * Fix for text inputs staying disabled after being re-enabled. The
    previous workaround for removing input panel was blocking re-
    enabling a previously enabled input. (LP: #1164634)
  * Fix for auto expanding TextArea eating flick events from Flickables.
    (LP: #1144077)
  * Benchmarks for time critical components.
  * Memory leak fixes lost from a previous MR.
  * [theming] Building selector for a styled item moved into Selector
    class. Previous functionality present in
    ItemStyleAttachedPrivate::updateStyleSelector() was moved into
    Selector class, class being responsible of building up the selectors
    from different sources. A selector can now be built up from a
    QQuickItem, in which case the item becomes the owner of the
    selector. Any additional update on the selector made by calling
    update() method will fetch the latest information from the owner and
    update the last node of the selector.
  * [theming] Style update optimization. - updateCurrentStyle() renamed
    to updateTheme() - resetStyle() ad resetDelegate() removed from
    updateStyle() and updateDelegate() respectively to avoid unnecessary
    calls on reset - updateTheme() checks whether the style rule has
    been changed, and compares whether style objects are different in
    the new style rule (this second part is more like prerequisite for
    an upcomming delegate detection MR) - setName() and setStyleClass()
    doe snot update the entire styleSelector - setName() and
    setStyleClass() apply styling changes on children -
    updateStyleSelector() became redundant, removed.
  * Fixing crash on custom style objects previously owned by other
    styled items. (LP: #1168006)
  * Unit converter example updated to use the latest UITK components.
  * [theming] Cache delegates separately from style objects and store
    the style object and the delegate type string in the style rule. In
    this way the theme engine can sort out unnecessary re-creation of
    delegates on a styled item when the style rule on the styled item
    gets changed and the previous and the new style rules share the same
    delegate component.
  * [theming] ItemStyle attached object detects now the time when the
    first styled item's attached component gets completed. In this way
    first time style object and delegate creation can be moved from re-
    parenting to completion.
  * Fix for crash in theme engine when loading application specific
    theme file in an app having a Popover instantiated. (LP: #1175394)
  * [theming] Removing deprecated functionality.
  * [theming] Changing stateful libraries to stateless to decrease time
    spent each time Ubuntu.Components module is imported. (LP: #1170638)
  * [theming] FontUtils converted from stateful JS library to native
    module due to its dependency to "units" context property.
  * [inversemaousearea] Fixing sensingArea not updated on phablet. (LP:
    #1166127)
  * InverseMouseArea sensingArea and Popovers' dismissArea works now
    when included in Window. (LP: #1182673)
  * [inversemousearea] Default sensing area not set on the proper time.
    (LP: #1185397)

  [ Juhapekka Piiroinen ]
  * Added missing QML2_IMPORT_PATH to unit test runner script.
  * Add a new Panel component that can be swiped in and out from an edge
    of the window by the user. As opposed to the default toolbar (which
    inherits from the Panel), a Panel can be attached to any edge of the
    screen, and the developer is free to define its contents. For
    standard cases, the automatic toolbar from the MainView and Page can
    still be used. API changes: * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool
    active TO property bool opened * CHANGED IN Toolbar: property bool
    lock TO property bool locked * CHANGED IN ToolbarActions: property
    bool active TO property bool opened * CHANGED IN ToolbarActions:
    property bool lock TO property bool locked. (LP: #1131209, #1116578,
    #1163395)
  * Adds Help file for Qt Creator usage. After this you can access
    documentation using F1.
  * Fix rules for qch files.
  * Build qch on qmake execution.
  * Fixes bug #1176132 [i18n] Set up the translation domain
    automatically Sets i18n.domain = applicationName on
    MainView::onApplicationNameChanged. (LP: #1176132)
  * Added depends for the docs install target. (LP: #1187006)
  * Improving autopilot tests.
  * Fix runtest.sh, it was missing xml argument on fallback execution.
    Removed testparser execution Added README file for unit tests. Added
    new targets: make test-performance <= runs performance tests make
    test-components <= runs functional tests for components make test-
    api <= runs api tests for components.
  * Fix failing textarea autopilot test by commenting out textarea tests
    for now.

  [ Olivier Tilloy ]
  * Added property TextField.inputMethodHints. (LP: #1185392)
  * When the clear button is not visible, ensure the text can use its
    space. (LP: #1186247)

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * enable horizontalAlignment for TextField and make the hint text
    follow its properties .

  [ tpeeters ]
  * Disable swiping to switch tabs by default. This is a preparation for
    the complete removal of the swipe-to-switch-tabs functionality cf.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/+bug/1166709.
  * Disable events on disabled controls inside list items. (LP:

  * Extend ActionList API so that Actions can be re-used by toolbars on
    multiple Pages. (LP: #1122864)
  * fix error in documentation of Action.
  * Combine the propagated properties of PageTreeNode in a single
    property propagated that contains all the other properties.
  * documentation fix.
  * Remove preliminary and deprecated HUD integration. Internal __hud
    property removed from MainView. (LP: #1129966)
  * Generate documentation for i18n. (LP: #1078631)
  * Add a test program that shows panels on different edges of the
    application view to tests/resources/toolbar. Like the other test
    programs in resources, this will come in handy for testing changes
    to the components.
  * revert changes to PageWrapperUtils.jp from revision 501 because it
    breaks phone-app. (LP: #1183456)
  * Properly internalize PageTreeNode's propagated property and tweak
    header behavior so that propagated.header does not need to be used
    by any of the apps: - CHANGED IN PageTreeNode: propagated TO
    __propagated - CHANGED IN Tabs: Automatically show the header when
    the title of the active tab changes - CHANGED IN Page/MainView: Only
    enable auto-hide behavior of header when the Page's flickable can be
    flicked vertically, so that manual setting of anchors is no longer
    needed for flickables that only flick horizontally (calendar-app).
  * comment on pragma library in PageWrapperUtils.js.
  * Add action property to AbstractButton, and use it in the toolbar.

  * revert changes to PageWrapperUtils.jp from revision 501 because it
    breaks phone-app. (LP: #1183456)
  * Properly internalize PageTreeNode's propagated property and tweak
    header behavior so that propagated.header does not need to be used
    by any of the apps: - CHANGED IN PageTreeNode: propagated TO
    __propagated - CHANGED IN Tabs: Automatically show the header when
    the title of the active tab changes - CHANGED IN Page/MainView: Only
    enable auto-hide behavior of header when the Page's flickable can be
    flicked vertically, so that manual setting of anchors is no longer
    needed for flickables that only flick horizontally (calendar-app).

  * Compatibility Breaks
    - Page, PageStack and Tabs automatically determine their anchors and height
      inside a MainView, so there is no need to set them explicitly.
    - It is now recommended to always use Pages inside Tabs or PageStack.
      Non-Page items can still be used, but their margins will not automatically
      be set-up to align with the header of the MainView.
  * API Changes (LP: #1157191)
    - Property tools was deprecated for MainView, Tabs and PageStack. Pages now automatically
      update MainView.toolbar.tools when they become active.
    - Property page of Tab can no longer be a URL, but must be an Item (Page recommended).
      Use a Loader if you were using a URL first.
